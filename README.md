# Quantum Error Correction Codes for Clifford Gates and T Gates
/This is the output from [the research-oriented project proposed in the Qiskit Advocate Mentor Program 2025](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-2025/issues/41#issuecomment-3320946065)/
 
The outputs are
- Library of QEC Codes
  - supporting transversal Clifford gates (../doubling-CSST/GO03_self_dual/    and     ../doubling-CSST/QR_dual_containing/)
  - supporting transversal T gates  (../doubling-CSST/JA25_triorthogonal/)
- Usage Example of the recursive doubling construction for new code supporting transversal T gates (../doubling-CSST/readAlist.ipynb)
  
- Decoding simulations on these code (../decoder/)
  - MWPF
  - BP-OSD
  - RelayBP
